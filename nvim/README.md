# 💤 LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by [💤 lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
to make it easy to customize and extend your config.
Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a
pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility
to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Transform your Neovim into a full-fledged IDE
- 💤 Easily customize and extend your config with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- 🚀 Blazingly fast
- 🧹 Sane default settings for options, autocmds, and keymaps
- 📦 Comes with a wealth of plugins pre-configured and ready to use

## ⚡️ Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)
- Git >= **2.19.0** (for partial clones support)
- a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) **_(optional)_**
